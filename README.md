- Run "Start VNC" from your application menu to start the vnc.
- Enter details in the VNC app in your android such as your ip address, port and password (details will be provided by a notification).
- Zoom in so that you are only able to see the second desktop (the black screen).
- You can move windows to your secondary monitor (android) with the help of your mouse.
- Enjoy!

Thanks for using this script! I know the code is quite bad because a lot of lines are repeated and I know I could've done this with bash instead of python but I don't know much about bash and my exams are near so I used Python because I already knew a lot about it! Thanks again!
